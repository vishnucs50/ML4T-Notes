## CAPM Math with 2 Stocks

r<sub>p</sub> = $\sum _i$ W<sub>i</sub>($\beta$<sub>i</sub>r<sub>m</sub> + $\alpha$<sub>i</sub>)
- r<sub>p</sub> = Return on Portfolio
- r<sub>m</sub> = Return on Market
- W<sub>i</sub> = Weight of that particular stock or allocation
    - W<sub>i</sub> is negative if you are shorting

1. Weight of stock A, W<sub>A</sub> = 0.5 or 50%<br>
Weight of stock B, W<sub>B</sub> = - 0.5 or 50% Shorting<br>
$\beta$<sub>A</sub> = 1.0<br>
$\beta$<sub>B</sub> = 2.0<br>
$\alpha$<sub>A</sub> = 1% This is how much you expect the stock to go up regardless of market movement<br>
$\alpha$<sub>B</sub> = -1% This is how much you expect the stock to go down regardless of market movement<br>
Return on market is not given. So, r<sub>m</sub> = ? <br>
What is the return on portfolio r<sub>p</sub>?<br>
<br>**Ans:** <br>
r<sub>p</sub> = $\sum _i$ W<sub>i</sub>($\beta$<sub>i</sub>r<sub>m</sub> + $\alpha$<sub>i</sub>)<br>
=> W<sub>A</sub>* $\beta$<sub>A</sub> * r<sub>m</sub> + W<sub>A</sub>* $\alpha$<sub>A</sub> + W<sub>B</sub> * $\beta$<sub>B</sub> * r<sub>m</sub> + W<sub>B</sub> * $\alpha$<sub>B</sub> <br>
=> r<sub>m</sub>(W<sub>A</sub>* $\beta$<sub>A</sub> + W<sub>B</sub> * $\beta$<sub>B</sub> ) + W<sub>A</sub>* $\alpha$<sub>A</sub> + W<sub>B</sub> * $\alpha$<sub>B</sub> <br>
=> r<sub>m</sub>(0.5 * 1.0 + -0.5 * 2.0) + 0.5 * 0.01 + (-)0.5 (-0.01)<br>
=> -0.5*r<sub>m</sub> +0.005 + 0.005<br>
=> -0.5*r<sub>m</sub> + 0.01 <br>

**If market went up 10%, then r<sub>m</sub> = 0.1**<br>
=> Portifolio return = -0.5*r<sub>m</sub> + 0.01 <br>
=> -0.5 * 0.1 + 0.01 <br>
=> -0.04 (or) -4%

**It is important to remember here that after doing market research, we came up with the $\alpha$<sub>A</sub> and $\alpha$<sub>B</sub> values.**
- Meaning, we did some research which lead us to believe that Stock A would go up 1% against the market, $\alpha$<sub>A</sub> = 1%, and Stock B would go down 1%, $\alpha$<sub>B</sub> = -1%.
- We normally don't know anything about the market returns in real-time. Therefore, r<sub>m</sub> is always `?`
- Look at this equation from above: -0.5*r<sub>m</sub> + 0.01 <br>
    - the 0.01 portion we computed using our alpha values from the market research we conducted.
    - -0.5*r<sub>m</sub> this is up in the air. We have no idea whether it market returns are gonna go up or down
- So, we can `remove the risk` if we can nullify this portion: -0.5*r<sub>m</sub> = `0` and preserve the 0.01 or 1% alpha.
    - To achieve this, we need weights W<sub>A</sub> & W<sub>B</sub> such that `their sum is 0`
