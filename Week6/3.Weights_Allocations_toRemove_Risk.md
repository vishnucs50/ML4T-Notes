## How to allocate weights.

Suppose we have 2 stocks A and B. <br>

- As A has +ve alpha we go for **Long**
- As B has -ve alpha we **Short** the stock.<br>
**Ans**<br>
We want to make W<sub>A</sub> $\beta$<sub>A</sub> + W<sub>B</sub> $\beta$<sub>B</sub> = 0<br>
=> W<sub>A</sub> + 2W<sub>B</sub> = 0<br>
=> W<sub>A</sub> = -2W<sub>B</sub><br>
Also, remember that `Absolute`(W<sub>A</sub>) + `Absolute`(W<sub>B</sub>) = 1 <br>
- Because these are weights that we are assigning to different stocks and they must add up to one.
- The reason for taking absolute wieght is beacuse when we short a stock, we assign it a `-ve weight`.
- In this example, W<sub>B</sub> has a negative weight
<br>
=> `Absolute`(W<sub>A</sub>) + `Absolute`(W<sub>B</sub>) = 1 <br>
=> W<sub>A</sub> = -2W<sub>B</sub><br>
Therefore, `Absolute` (-2W<sub>B</sub>) + `Absolute`(W<sub>B</sub>) = 1 <br>
=> 3`abs` (W<sub>B</sub>) = 1<br>
=> W<sub>B</sub> = 1/3<br>
As we are **Shorting** B, it will get a -ve sign<br>
=> W<sub>B</sub> = -1/3<br>
=> W<sub>A</sub> = -2(-1/3)<br>
=> W<sub>A</sub> = 2/3<br>

**Final Weight Allocations are W<sub>A</sub> = 2/3 and W<sub>B</sub> = -1/3**

## Plugging these values into our original qustion to compute r<sub>p</sub> - Portfolio return

- We get a 1% portfolio return regardless of which way the market goes now, as removed the market return risk.
