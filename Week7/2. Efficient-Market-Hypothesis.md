## Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)
1. The assumptions made by **EMH**:
    - There are a large number of investors interacting in the market for profit.
        - They have a lot of incentive to find stocks that are out of line with their true values.
    - New information arrives randomly.
    - Prices are adjusting quickly.
        - This is becuase the investors are paying attention to the randomly arriving information.
    - Current prices reflect all available information
2. Where does information come from? (below is not an exhaustive list)
    - Price/Volume
    - Fundamental data
    - **Exogenous**: This is the info of the world that affects the company.
        - **Ex**: Price of oil goes down resulting in price of airlines going up becuase the tickets become cheaper and more people can fly.
    - **Company Insiders**: Most secreative information

### 3 forms of Effective Markets Hypothesis (EMH)
There are 3 versions of EMH that go from weak to strong
1. **Weak form of EMH**: Future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing historical prices.
    - This could mean that Fundamental analysis might prevail.

2. **Semi Strong form of EMH**: Prices adjust rapidly to new public information. 
    - This could prohibit fundamental analysis.
    - But we could still make money on the insider information.

3. **Strong form of EMH**: Prices reflect all infromation public and private.
