However, since the project asks for five indicators, you'll need to come up with two more. Some potential ideas for the additional indicators could be:

1. **Momentum**: This measures the speed at which a stock's price is moving. It’s calculated by subtracting the price from some previous period from the current price.
    - Formula: <code>Momentum = Current Price - Price N periods ago</code>
    - You can use this to identify stocks that are picking up in speed or losing momentum.
2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: This is a trend-following momentum indicator. It’s the difference between a short-term EMA (typically 12 days) and a long-term EMA (typically 26 days).
    - Formula: `MACD = EMA(12) - EMA(26)`
    - You can then use the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD) to generate buy/sell signals.
