## Future value of money

FV = PV (1+r)<sup>i</sup>
- i = time period
- r = interest rate

1. Example: US govt gives 1% interest rate. If US govt gave you $1 at the end of the year, what is it worth today.
    - ***Sol***: PV = 1/(1+0.01)<sup>1</sup>
    - PV = $0.99
    - So instead they can just give you $0.99 today.

## Intrinsic Value

If a company pays you $1 in perpetuity, the interest = 5%, what is the PV?

- PV in perpetuity = FV/r
- PV = 1/0.05 = $20

This is also called Intrinsic value.

- EX:
    - Dividends = $2 /yr
    - Interest/ Discount Rate = 4%
    - PV = ?
    - PV = 2/0.04 
    - PV = $50

## Book value

It is the total assets minus intangible assets & liabilities.
- Intangible asset: Assets that are hard to value. For example patents.

## Market Capitalization

Market Cap = #shares * $price
