# Understanding RMSE and Correlation in Regression Models

## What is RMSE?
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** measures the average magnitude of errors between the predicted and actual values.
- **Lower RMSE** indicates better accuracy, meaning the model's predictions are closer to the actual values on average.

## What is Correlation (corr)?
- **Correlation (corr)** measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between predicted values and actual values.
- **Range**: -1 to 1
  - **1**: Perfect positive correlation (as actual values increase, predictions increase proportionally).
  - **0**: No linear correlation (no relationship between predictions and actual values).
  - **-1**: Perfect negative correlation (as actual values increase, predictions decrease).
- **Higher correlation** means the model captures more of the patterns or trends in the data.

## How to Interpret RMSE and Correlation Together

### RMSE:
- Tells you **how far off** the predictions are from the actual values, on average.
- It **does not indicate** whether errors are random or if the model is capturing trends in the data.

### Correlation:
- Tells you **how well the model captures the relationship** between the input features and the target variable.
- A **higher correlation** indicates that as actual values increase, predictions also increase, showing the model understands the trend.

### When Used Together:
- **Low RMSE + High Correlation**: The model is making accurate predictions and capturing the correct trends.
- **Low RMSE + Low Correlation**: The model may have low average error, but it may not follow the actual trends in the data.
- **High RMSE + High Correlation**: The model captures the trends but makes larger prediction errors.
- **High RMSE + Low Correlation**: The model neither captures trends nor predicts accurately.

## Example Interpretation of Results:
In-sample RMSE: 0.5286 | Correlation: 0.6628 Out-of-sample RMSE: 0.5950 | Correlation: 0.5461


### In-Sample:
- **RMSE (0.5286)** is fairly low, suggesting accurate predictions.
- **Corr (0.6628)** is strong, indicating the model is capturing the relationships in the training data well.

### Out-of-Sample:
- **RMSE (0.5950)** is slightly higher, but still reasonable, showing the model generalizes fairly well to new data.
- **Corr (0.5461)** is lower, meaning some predictive power is lost when moving to unseen data, but the model still captures trends.

---

## Final Takeaway:
- **RMSE** tells you how accurate the predictions are on average.
- **Correlation** tells you how well the model captures patterns in the data.
- **Both metrics together** provide a more complete picture of model performance: RMSE for error magnitude and correlation for trend alignment.
